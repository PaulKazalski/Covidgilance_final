# Welcome to COVIDgilance!
COVID-19 has already caused tens of thousands of deaths in the United States alone, and researchers still don’t know very much about it.  This lack of information makes an already frightening situation even scarier.  To aid in the cause against this terrible disease, COVIDgilance is using machine learning and data visualization to provide one of the most effective countermeasures against this pandemic – knowledge.  

## About this repository
COVIDgilance is comprised of students of Rutgers’ data science boot camp: Meghna Agnish, Will Giordano, Maria-Elena Gorini, Paul Kazalski, and Flomo Kokro. It is designed to showcase the topics that were covered in class: Tableau visualizations, Python coding, and Keras Machine Learning, among others.
